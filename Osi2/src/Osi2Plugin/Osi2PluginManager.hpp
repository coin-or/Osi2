/*! \brief Plugin library manager

  This class provides generic support for loading and unloading plugin
  libraries. As libraries are loaded, they register the APIs that they support
  with the manager. Clients can then ask for objects which support a registered
  API. APIs are identified by strings.

  There is a single instance of the plugin manager (declared as a static
  object private to #getInstance).

  The act of loading a plugin library is an atomic transaction managed by
  #loadOneLib: The library must be found, loaded, and successfully complete
  its initialisation function before registration information is copied into
  the manager's client-accessible data structures.

  APIs are registered by plugin libraries; a character string identifies
  each API. If the registration string is exactly "*", the registration is
  classed as a wildcard and entered in the #wildCardVec_. Otherwise, it will
  be entered in the #exactMatchMap_ using the character string as the key.
  Duplicate registrations are not allowed; each <API string,library> pair
  must be unique. A corollary of this is that there is at most one entry
  per library in the #wildCardVec_.

  Clients request an object supporting a specific API by specifying a
  character string.  If an exact match for the API requested by the client
  is found in #exactMatchMap_, the corresponding create function is invoked
  and the object is returned to the client.

  If no exact match is found, the #wildCardVec_ is scanned. For each entry,
  the corresponding create function is invoked to attempt to create an
  object supporting the requested API. If the plugin library responds with
  an object, an entry is made in the #exactMatchMap_ so that subsequent
  requests for the same API can be satisfied more efficiently. The plugin
  library may chose to invoke the registration function itself to create the
  exact match entry, before returning the object. Otherwise the PluginManager
  creates an exact match entry from information in the wild card vector entry.

  Any request for an object supporting a particular API can be qualified with
  a request that the object be supplied by a particular library.

  To allow Osi2 to provide utility APIs through compiled-in `plugin
  libraries'.  The PluginManager class provides a hook, #addPreloadLib, to
  allow these `plugins' to register their APIs. The expected technique is
  for the file defining the class to instantiate a single file-local static
  object using a constructor whose main purpose is to invoke #addPreloadLib
  with the library's name and \link Osi2::InitFunc initialisation function
  \endlink as parameters. Note that this special-purpose constructor must
  invoke #getInstance to insure that an instance of the PluginManager has been
  created.
